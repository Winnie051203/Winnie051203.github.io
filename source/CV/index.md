Hello everyone, my Chinese name is Wang Bowen and my English name is Winnie. I am a 19-year-old college student majoring in Business studying at Macao University of Science and Technology.

I am a lively and cheerful, a little funny girl. My friends first impression of me is  cold, but contact will find that I am a funny girl, even a little neurotic.I also like to make friends. I find it interesting to communicate with all kinds of people.My constellation is Sagittarius, frank personality, not too much thought, and self-esteem. My mbti is enfj, and I also care about the feelings of fellow travelers.In my life, I play the role of caring for others. I am afraid that my behavior will bring trouble to others, so I often fall into internal conflict and prefer to deal with things alone. In the study, I also play a hard-working person, but the results are still not ideal, I often tell myself, it doesn't matter that you have been better than yesterday.

   Of course I have many tags, if you want to learn more about me please click on the other links.
