My life at school is actually very simple. I have class, eat, and go to the library every day. But there are many small surprises in this ordinary life.


## My best friend

My friend and I have known each other for seven years, although we are not in the same university, we miss each other.

## Delicious food


Delicious food is the antidote to life. In the busy study life, let the food take away our fatigue.
